# Willow Bark Co-op Website

This is the website. It uses [Hugo].

To preview the site run `hugo serve`, to build it (into the `public/` tree by
default) just run `hugo`.

If you're not familiar with Hugo and just want to modify site content see the
`content/` tree.
If you want to modify the actual layout see `themes/salix/` and consider reading
_[Introduction to Hugo Templating]_.
