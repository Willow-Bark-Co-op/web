When building software we attempt to re-use and support software that is Open
Source or other similar licensing schemes without exploiting the labor of those
writing the software that we depend on.

We also license many of our own shared components into the commons.
This means that they are looked at by many sets of eyes and are re-used between
projects, resulting in lower overhead for your organization when fixing
components of your custom software!
