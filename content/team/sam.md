Sam has over 8 years of experience delivering projects for some of the largest
and most scalable codebases in the world.
He also has extensive open source and standards body work including
contributions to projects such as the Go programming language, Docker, and
authoring specs for the IETF and XSF.
In 2014 Sam set out to do a bit of lite hiking at the southern terminus of the
Appalachian Trail in Georgia.
Five and a half months later he found himself submitting Mt. Katahdin, roughly
2100 miles from where he started.
