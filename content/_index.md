### Websites and Design

We focus on engaging and accessible websites for businesses, co-ops, and
nonprofits.
Each site includes a unique design and brand development tailored to your
mission and goals as well as CMS integration and training.
Our websites are designed to be easy to read and to meet Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines.
Rates can be tailored to include long-term development or a one-off design.
We work closely with our clients to ensure your needs are met.

### Cloud Services

After your website is built we can host your site, setup instant messaging for
your small business, or advise you on custom hosting and infrastructure
development.
We can provide assistance setting up bare metal hosting or building
infrastructure using a range of common providers including Joyent Triton,
DigitalOcean, Linode, Terraform, and more!
To keep your site and services up and running we can also setup monitoring using
popular tools such as Prometheus and Grafana.

### Custom Backends

Our developers specialize in languages including Go, JavaScript, Python, and
Rust and can build custom backends and services to meet your individual needs.
We focus on best practices including extensive code review and writing idiomatic
and readable code so that the resulting product is simple and understandable.

communication technologies make us a perfect fit for most business needs.

{{< section title="Values" class="list-section" >}}

Our values are important to us and are one of the reasons our clients trust us.
Some of them include:


### Democratic egalitarian member control.

We are a worker owned co-op meaning our developers and designers own the
business and operate it in a democratic manner.
We believe that the lack of big bosses makes for a happy and productive
workplace which results in a better product.


### Accountable to impacted communities.

Writing software that will be used by others is an inherently political act.
When we write software that is used by your organization, we feel that it makes
us accountable to you and the communities you serve.
Software is for people, and we strive to write software for them, not just for
the bottom line.


### Privacy, decentralization, & autonomy.

The internet is for everyone.
We believe that decentralized, autonomous communities can help make the internet
a safer and more enjoyable place to be.


### The Commons.

When building software we attempt to re-use and support software that is Open
Source or other similar licensing schemes without exploiting the labor of those
writing the software that we depend on.

We also license many of our own shared components into the commons.
This means that they are looked at by many sets of eyes and are re-used between
projects, resulting in lower overhead for your organization when fixing
components of your custom software!


### Sustainable economics and ecology.

It is possible to build a business that is both sustainable and profitable.
Wherever possible we strive to use and build sustainable technologies that
operate efficiently and with minimal waste.
