Our values are important to us and are one of the reasons our clients trust us.
Some of them include:


### Democratic egalitarian member control.

We are a worker owned co-op meaning our developers and designers own the
business and operate it in a democratic manner.
We believe that the lack of big bosses makes for a happy and productive
workplace which results in a better product.


### Accountable to impacted communities.

Writing software that will be used by others is an inherently political act.
When we write software that is used by your organization, we feel that it makes
us accountable to you and the communities you serve.
Software is for people, and we strive to write software for them, not just for
the bottom line.


### Privacy, decentralization, & autonomy.

The internet is for everyone.
We believe that decentralized, autonomous communities can help make the internet
a safer and more enjoyable place to be.


### The Commons.

When building software we attempt to re-use and support software that is Open
Source or other similar licensing schemes without exploiting the labor of those
writing the software that we depend on.

We also license many of our own shared components into the commons.
This means that they are looked at by many sets of eyes and are re-used between
projects, resulting in lower overhead for your organization when fixing
components of your custom software!


### Sustainable economics and ecology.

It is possible to build a business that is both sustainable and profitable.
Wherever possible we strive to use and build sustainable technologies that
operate efficiently and with minimal waste.
