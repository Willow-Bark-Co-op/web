### Websites and Design

We focus on engaging and accessible websites for businesses, co-ops, and
nonprofits.
Each site includes a unique design and brand development tailored to your
mission and goals as well as CMS integration and training.
Our websites are designed to be easy to read and to meet Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines.
Rates can be tailored to include long-term development or a one-off design.
We work closely with our clients to ensure your needs are met.

### Cloud Services

After your website is built we can host your site, setup instant messaging for
your small business, or advise you on custom hosting and infrastructure
development.
We can provide assistance setting up bare metal hosting or building
infrastructure using a range of common providers including Joyent Triton,
DigitalOcean, Linode, Terraform, and more!
To keep your site and services up and running we can also setup monitoring using
popular tools such as Prometheus and Grafana.
